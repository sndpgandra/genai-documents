## Business Problem & Opportunity

### Current State Challenges
- **One-size-fits-all enrollment**: High abandonment rates (40%) for complex scenarios
- **Manual complexity handling**: 3-4 customer service calls per complex enrollment
- **Compliance risks**: Coverage gaps during life events and state transitions
- **Scalability limitations**: Unable to handle growing regulatory complexity

### Market Opportunity
Transform benefits enrollment from **transactional process** to **intelligent consultation**, creating a platform that adapts to customer circumstances rather than forcing customers to navigate complex rules.

Step 1: Verify employment transition timeline and benefit continuity
Step 2: Identify qualifying life event windows for both employers  
Step 3: Assess spouse's current coverage to prevent gaps
Step 4: Calculate optimal timing for benefit changes
Step 5: Compare COBRA vs. new employer coverage options
Step 6: Plan dependent addition with required documentation
Step 7: Set automated reminders for critical deadlines

Result: 85%+ completion rate, zero coverage gaps, customer satisfaction
